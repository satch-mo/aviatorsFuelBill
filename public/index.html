            <p class="warning">WARNING: this tool is to be used strictly for reference and is based on averages of plane data. When estimating fuel consumption there are a variety of factors that are to be taken into account, such as engine RPM, altitude, prop pitch, fuel/air mixture, wind direction, higher fuel burn during climb, engine condition, etc. </p>
            <p class="warning">ALWAYS make sure you have an adequate reserve to get you to an alternative destination should there be a reason your initial destination becomes unapproachable mid-flight.</p>
            <p class="warning">Remember, takeoffs are optional but landings are mandatory. Happy flying!</p>
